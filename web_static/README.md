## Project Description

This project aims to build the front-end of the AirBnB clone step by step. The focus will be on developing the basic structure of each page, creating a style guide for consistent design, adding fake content for testing, and ensuring responsive design. No JavaScript will be used in this phase, and the main goal is to create static pages that form the foundation of the final web application.
